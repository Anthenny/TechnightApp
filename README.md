# General

This project is created using React Native on the frontend and Node.js on the backend.
This App is partly written in Javascript, if we have the time we are supposed to convert the application to Typescript.

# Requirements â˜•
- Docker
- Docker-compose
- Able to run make commands

# Getting started

Only the API is functioning at this point in time!

<!-- TODO Makefile and dockerfiles in the root dir so you can run all the commands from there. -->

## First time running the application

1. Cd in the backend-v2 directory and use `make build`. This will build the application getting everything u need to use this API. When it's done getting the dependencies it will spin up the containers.
2. After building and spinning up the containers go to http://localhost:5000/ , please give the containers the time to startup.

## Errors

If you have errors make sure to use `docker ps`. If you see that a container is down or trying to restart use `docker logs -f <container name or ID>`

## Database

In this project use MongoDB combined with express and mongoose.

This project uses Mongo-Express, this allows us to have a web-based MongoDB admin interface. To see this go to http://localhost:5000/ . 

We can also use the CLI. To do this run `docker exec -it mongo mongo -u "admin" -p "admin12345"`. This should give u a welcome message. From here on out we can use mongo commands such as `show dbs` and `use <db_name_here>`

## Backend folders

All the code is in the src folder. The project is using the MVC structure.

In the utils folder we have a appError and a catchAsync file. The appError allows us to make our own error messages with our own statusCode. Then we have the catchAsync file that allows us to skip the repetative try and catch blocks.

In the middleware folder we have the validateResource file and a corsMiddleware. The validateResource file validates the body,req and params. We tell this function which schema we are using and it will do the rest. In the corsMiddleware file we define what methods and headers this API can receive. We can also define the wesbsites that are allowed to connect to our API.
